LeetCode #205
Isomorphic Strings

Approach:
- Use two hash maps:
      * s_to_t map characters from 's' to 't'
      * t_to_s map characters from 't' to 's'
- Iterate through both strings simultaneously
- Validate mappings in both directions to ensure a one-to-one mapping

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
